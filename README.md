# Standalone-SDK
The Standalone SDK is a powerful middleware that enables the creation of professional desktop apps for HR, payroll, and attendance management.  For nearly 15 years, it has been seamlessly incorporated into a diverse range of ZKTeco time attendance and access control systems.

Built on a rock-solid SDK architecture, it allows developers to easily create any time-related software solution.  One of its primary benefits is seamless compatibility with all ZKTeco gear, which eliminates the need to manage or setup separate terminals.  Simply connect and start building; the hardware works flawlessly.
